# Privacy Policy — 30 Days Running

Effective date: December 9, 2025

## 1. Introduction
This privacy policy explains how 30 Days Running (the “App”) handles your information. The App operates entirely on your device and does not use any servers.

## 2. Data Collection
- The App does not collect personal data from you.
- Any information you enter remains on your device.

## 3. Data Usage
- Data you enter is used solely to provide core App functionality on your device.
- No analytics SDKs, tracking technologies, or advertising identifiers are used.

## 4. Data Sharing and Selling
- The App does not share your data with any third parties.
- The App does not sell your data.

## 5. Storage and Security
- All data is stored locally on your device within the App’s storage.
- We recommend you use your device’s security features (passcode, Face/Touch ID) and keep your device software up to date. No storage method is 100% secure.

## 6. Your Controls
- You can edit or delete entries within the App.
- Deleting the App will remove local data stored by the App from your device.
- If your device supports system backups (e.g., iCloud, Google Drive), those backups may include the App’s local data under your control.
