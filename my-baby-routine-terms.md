## 3. Purpose — Not Medical Advice
The App is a tool to help parents and caregivers log and organize baby activities (such as feeding, sleep, and diapers). It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals with questions about your baby’s health.

- Maintaining the security of your device and any credentials
- Complying with applicable laws when using the App

## 5. Data and Privacy
The App stores data you enter (e.g., routines, notes, activity logs) on your device and on our servers to enable backup and syncing. We do not sell or share your data with third parties. For details on what we collect, how we use it, and your choices, please see the My Baby Routine Privacy Policy.

## 6. License and Intellectual Property
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes. The App and its content are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or distribute the App except as permitted by law.

## 9. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you violate these Terms or use the App in a way that may cause harm. You may stop using the App at any time. Upon termination, sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., disclaimers, liability limits) will remain in effect.

## 10. Disclaimers
The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted or error-free.
